# pQt.qHotel
This is a Qt, PyQt, PySide wrapper. Instead of importing from PySide2, which might change in other senarios for example importing from PyQt5, it is not very handy to change all the imports in each file that uses Qt functions.

> usage:

```python 
from peach.pQt.qHotel import QtWidgets, QtGui
```
